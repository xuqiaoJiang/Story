Oct.27 Friday

It's another day when I heard people shout into the air when they saw me and my dog Rocky. "that dog is so big." with scared tone. That's funny because my dog is smaller than what a pure Lab should be, he's only 58 pounds. Well, I wish he could be "so big", to be fair enough.

Nowadays people are not so kind towards dogs, they think dogs are evil, "they eat child". News of how Rowtail harmed a girl sparked outrage human hates of dogs, especially with a larger size than Teddy.

Everytime I feel hurt and angry when they say to their child, "stay away with that dog!", and act some urgent movements like holding their "baby" into arms and throwing ugly face or voice toward my dog. Luckily, my dog feels nothing, he just plays who he is, looking for smells from other dogs, pee on trees he likes, playing with balls if he remember to take one with him, or just picking up branches from the ground. If lukier, playing with stones! He love stones, and he can play with it all day long if it's permitted.

I should learn from Rocky.

Yours,
Jojo
